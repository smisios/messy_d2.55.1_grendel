  abstract = {The Modal Aerosol Dynamics model for Europe (MADE) has been developed
	as an extension to mesoscale chemistry transport models to allow
	a more detailed treatment of aerosol effects in these models. Due
	to the complexity of the atmospheric aerosol system an approach has
	been chosen which is, on the one hand, fast enough for this application
	and, on the other, provides sufficient information on the particle
	size distribution. In MADE, which is developed from the regional
	particulate model (RPM) the particle size distribution of the submicrometer
	aerosol is represented by two overlapping lognormal modes. The chemical
	composition is currently treated in the sulfate--nitrate--ammonium
	and water system. Sources for aerosol particles are modelled through
	nucleation and emission. Coagulation, condensation, transport and
	deposition are considered as processes modifying the aerosol population
	in the atmosphere. Aerosol dynamics calculations are performed on-line
	within the chemistry-transport model. Process studies with a one-dimensional
	version of the model system are used to investigate the relative
	importance of the individual aerosol dynamic processes and the important
	links between between the gas and aerosol phase as well as meteorological
	parameters. Results from a first three-dimensional application of
	the fully coupled system of {MADE} and the European Air Pollution
	Dispersion model system (EURAD) are presented, showing the suitability
	of {MADE} as an aerosol dynamics model even within complex air quality
	models. The application of the new aerosol model provides information
	on particle number, size and surface area in addition to the chemical
	concentration fields, which can be used to study a variety of aerosol-related
	air pollution issues in subsequent studies. },

  abstract = {Black carbon (BC) and mineral dust are among the most abundant insoluble
	aerosol components in the atmosphere. When released, most BC and
	dust particles are externally mixed with other aerosol species. Through
	coagulation with particles containing soluble material and condensation
	of gases, the externally mixed particles may obtain a liquid coating
	and be transferred into an internal mixture. The mixing state of
	BC and dust aerosol particles influences their radiative and hygroscopic
	properties, as well as their ability of forming ice crystals. We
	introduce the new aerosol microphysics submodel MADE-in, implemented
	within the ECHAM/ MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry global model (EMAC).
	MADE-in is able to track mass and number concentrations of BC and
	dust particles in their different mixing states, as well as particles
	free of BC and dust. MADE-in describes these three classes of particles
	through a superposition of seven log-normally distributed modes,
	and predicts the evolution of their size distribution and chemical
	composition. Six out of the seven modes are mutually interacting,
	allowing for the transfer of mass and number among them. Separate
	modes for the different mixing states of BC and dust particles in
	EMAC/MADE-in allow for explicit simulations of the relevant aging
	processes, i.e. condensation, coagulation and cloud processing. EMAC/
	MADE-in has been evaluated with surface and airborne measurements
	and mostly performs well both in the planetary boundary layer and
	in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere.},

  abstract = {We introduce MADE3 (Modal Aerosol Dynamics model for Europe, adapted
	for global applications, 3rd generation; version: MADE3v2.0b), an
	aerosol dynamics submodel for application within the MESSy framework
	(Modular Earth Submodel System). MADE3 builds on the predecessor
	aerosol submodels MADE and MADE-in. Its main new features are the
	explicit representation of coarse mode particle interactions both
	with other particles and with condensable gases, and the inclusion
	of hydrochloric acid (HCl) / chloride (Cl) partitioning between the
	gas and condensed phases. The aerosol size distribution is represented
	in the new submodel as a superposition of nine lognormal modes: one
	for fully soluble particles, one for insoluble particles, and one
	for mixed particles in each of three size ranges (Aitken, accumulation,
	and coarse mode size ranges).
	
	In order to assess the performance of MADE3 we compare it to its predecessor
	MADE and to the much more detailed particle-resolved aerosol model
	PartMC-MOSAIC in a box model simulation of an idealised marine boundary
	layer test case. MADE3 and MADE results are very similar, except
	in the coarse mode, where the aerosol is dominated by sea spray particles.
	Cl is reduced in MADE3 with respect to MADE due to the HCl / Cl partitioning
	that leads to Cl removal from the sea spray aerosol in our test case.
	Additionally, the aerosol nitrate concentration is higher in MADE3
	due to the condensation of nitric acid on coarse mode particles.
	MADE3 and PartMC-MOSAIC show substantial differences in the fine
	particle size distributions (sizes $\leq$ 2 $\mu$m) that could be
	relevant when simulating climate effects on a global scale. Nevertheless,
	the agreement between MADE3 and PartMC-MOSAIC is very good when it
	comes to coarse particle size distributions (sizes $\geq$ 2 $\mu$m),
	and also in terms of aerosol composition. Considering these results
	and the well-established ability of MADE in reproducing observed
	aerosol loadings and composition, MADE3 seems suitable for application
	within a global model.},

  abstract = {International shipping contributes significantly to the fuel consumption
	of all transport related activities. Specific emissions of pollutants
	such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) per kg of fuel emitted are higher than
	for road transport or aviation. Besides gaseous pollutants, ships
	also emit various types of particulate matter. The aerosol impacts
	the Earth's radiation budget directly by scattering and absorbing
	the solar and thermal radiation and indirectly by changing cloud
	properties. Here we use ECHAM5/MESSy1-MADE, a global climate model
	with detailed aerosol and cloud microphysics to study the climate
	impacts of international shipping. The simulations show that emissions
	from ships significantly increase the cloud droplet number concentration
	of low marine water clouds by up to 5\% to 30\% depending on the
	ship emission inventory and the geographic region. Whereas the cloud
	liquid water content remains nearly unchanged in these simulations,
	effective radii of cloud droplets decrease, leading to cloud optical
	thickness increase of up to 5--10\%. The sensitivity of the results
	is estimated by using three different emission inventories for present-day
	conditions. The sensitivity analysis reveals that shipping contributes
	to 2.3\% to 3.6\% of the total sulfate burden and 0.4\% to 1.4\%
	to the total black carbon burden in the year 2000 on the global mean.
	In addition to changes in aerosol chemical composition, shipping
	increases the aerosol number concentration, e.g. up to 25\% in the
	size range of the accumulation mode (typically $>0.1$ $\mu$m) over
	the Atlantic. The total aerosol optical thickness over the Indian
	Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Northeastern Pacific increases
	by up to 8--10\% depending on the emission inventory. Changes in
	aerosol optical thickness caused by shipping induced modification
	of aerosol particle number concentration and chemical composition
	lead to a change in the shortwave radiation budget at the top of
	the atmosphere (ToA) under clear-sky condition of about $-0.014$
	W/m2 to $-0.038$ W/m2 for a global annual average. The corresponding
	all-sky direct aerosol forcing ranges between $-0.011$ W/m2 and $-0.013$
	W/m2. The indirect aerosol effect of ships on climate is found to
	be far larger than previously estimated. An indirect radiative effect
	of $-0.19$ W/m2 to $-0.60$ W/m2 (a change in the atmospheric shortwave
	radiative flux at ToA) is calculated here, contributing 17\% to 39\%
	of the total indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosols. This contribution
	is high because ship emissions are released in regions with frequent
	low marine clouds in an otherwise clean environment. In addition,
	the potential impact of particulate matter on the radiation budget
	is larger over the dark ocean surface than over polluted regions
	over land.},

  abstract = {The aerosol dynamics module MADE has been coupled to the general circulation
	model ECHAM4 to simulate the chemical composition, number concentration,
	and size distribution of the global submicrometer aerosol. The present
	publication describes the new model system ECHAM4/MADE and presents
	model results in comparison with observations. The new model is able
	to simulate the full life cycle of particulate matter and various
	gaseous particle precursors including emissions of primary particles
	and trace gases, advection, convection, diffusion, coagulation, condensation,
	nucleation of sulfuric acid vapor, aerosol chemistry, cloud processing,
	and size-dependent dry and wet deposition. Aerosol components considered
	are sulfate (SO(4)), ammonium (NH(4)), nitrate (NO(3)), black carbon
	(BC), particulate organic matter (POM), sea salt, mineral dust, and
	aerosol liquid water. The model is numerically efficient enough to
	allow long term simulations, which is an essential requirement for
	application in general circulation models. Since the current study
	is focusing on the submicrometer aerosol, a coarse mode is not being
	simulated. The model is run in a passive mode, i.e. no feedbacks
	between the MADE aerosols and clouds or radiation are considered
	yet. This allows the investigation of the effect of aerosol dynamics,
	not interfered by feedbacks of the altered aerosols on clouds, radiation,
	and on the model dynamics. In order to evaluate the results obtained
	with this new model system, calculated mass concentrations, particle
	number concentrations, and size distributions are compared to observations.
	The intercomparison shows, that ECHAM4/MADE is able to reproduce
	the major features of the geographical patterns, seasonal cycle,
	and vertical distributions of the basic aerosol parameters. In particular,
	the model performs well under polluted continental conditions in
	the northern hemispheric lower and middle troposphere. However, in
	comparatively clean remote areas, e. g. in the upper troposphere
	or in the southern hemispheric marine boundary layer, the current
	model version tends to underestimate particle number concentrations.},

	aerosols and aerosol associated water on a global scale. We have
	coupled a computationally efficient gas-aerosol scheme (EQSAM) to
	a global atmospheric chemistry-transport model (TM3). Our results
	show that gas/aerosol partitioning strongly affects the gas-phase
	concentrations at relatively low temperatures. During winter and
	at night during all seasons the calculated aerosol load, including
	water, is considerably higher than without accounting for gas/aerosol
	partitioning. The reason is that gaseous nitric acid near the surface
	is often neutralized by ammonia and therefore partitions almost completely
	into the aerosol phase to yield ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). The aerosol
	NH4NO3 has a longer atmospheric residence time compared to the corresponding
	precursor gases (NH3 and HNO3) and can therefore be transported over
	larger distances, for instance from India to Africa and Europe. These
	modeling results are intriguing; however, verification requires in
	situ measurements. A comparison with a limited set of ground-based
	measurements indicates that our model yields realistic results for
	the ammonium-sulfate-nitrate-water aerosol system in relatively polluted
	locations where ammonium nitrate is important. For remote locations
	for which we underestimate the total aerosol load, however, it will
	be necessary to also account for other aerosol species such as sea
	salt, mineral dust and organic compounds. We further show that assumptions
	on turbulent mixing and model resolution have a much stronger effect
	on aerosol calculations than the uncertainties resulting from the

  abstract = {In this paper we present parameterized equations for calculation of
	sulfuric acid-water critical nucleus compositions, critical cluster
	radii and homogeneous nucleation rates for tropospheric and stratospheric
	conditions. The parameterizations are based on a classical nucleation
	model. We used an improved model for the hydrate formation relying
	on ab initio calculations of small sulfuric acid clusters and on
	experimental data for vapor pressures and equilibrium constants for
	hydrate formation. The most rigorous nucleation kinetics and the
	thermodynamically consistent version of the classical binary homogeneous
	nucleation theory were used. The parameterized nucleation rates are
	compared with experimental ones, and at room temperature and relative
	humidities above 30\% they are within experimental error. At lower
	temperatures and lower humidities the agreement is somewhat poorer.
	Overall, the values of nucleation rates are increased compared to
	a previous parameterization and are within an order of magnitude
	compared with theoretical values for all conditions studied. The
	parameterized equations will reduce the computing time by a factor
	1/500 compared to nonparameterized nucleation rate calculations and
	therefore are in particular useful for large-scale models. The parameterized
	formulas are valid at temperatures between 230.15 K and 305.15 K,
	relative humidities between 0.01\% and 100\%, and sulfuric acid concentrations
	from 1e4 to 1e11 cm-3. They can be used to extrapolate the classical
	results down to 190 K. The parametrization is limited to cases where
	nucleation rates are between 1e7 and 1e10 cm-3 s-1, and the critical
	cluster contains at least four molecules.},
