PI TANS experiment

Goals:

- Estimate req. spin-up times for (isotopic) CH4 for (pseudo) PI conditions
  + for emitted and "nudged" CH4
- Revisit the subject of 1997.GBC11.Tans (two-box) model study, using EMAC
  + Not only 13C but D and 14C included
- Test the effect of diurnally modulated OH

Setup:

- non-specified dynamics
- 2000-like perpetual condtions
- emission rel. distr. comes from EMAC ESCiMO CH4_fx emissions
- sinks are
  + for Tans tracers, OH-only from Spivakovsky et al. 2000
  + OH, O(1D), Cl, hv from ESCiMO 

- "Tans" tracers
  + emission of CH4, 12CH4, 13CH4, CH3D, 14CH4
    + integral flux = 250 Tg/yr in the ETNH only
    + emission isotope composition is constant:
      d13C = -50 o/oo, dD = -280 o/oo, 14CH4 = 100 pMC
  (opt.) Doubling of NH emission at a given moment (75 yrs)
  + CH4 removal is by "payched" Spivakovsky OH

- "Regular" tracers
  + Emission of CH4,
    + integral flux = CH4_fx from ESCiMO RC1SD-base-07 for 2000
      - only natural components
    + emission isotope composition is constant:
      d13C = -50 o/oo, dD = -280 o/oo, 14CH4 = 100 pMC

- "Nudged" to PI tracers
  + lower boundary (prepared from 1950 data, scaling back to PI)
