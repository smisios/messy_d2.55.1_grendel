README_DEFAULTS
===============

Default namelists for CMIP6 are summatized in three default folders, sorted
by general EMAC setup used.

DEFAULTS       - folder for general defaults or defaults that will be used 
                 when MPIOM is not used.
                 
             
DEFAULTS_CHEM  - folder for default submodel namelists used with chemistry
                 setup.


DEFAULTS_OCE   - folder for general defaults or defaults that will be used 
                 when setting depend on the usage of MPIOM.
                 Two versions for the following namelists exist:
                 
                  - channel.nml, cloudopt.nml, switch.nml
                  
                 with chemistry     |  without chemistry
                 ----------------------------------------
                 channel-chem.nml   |  channel-d.nml
                 cloudopt-chem.nml  |  cloudopt.nml
                 switch-chem.nml    |  switch.nml
