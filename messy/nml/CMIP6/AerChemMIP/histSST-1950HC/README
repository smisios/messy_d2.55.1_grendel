README CMIP6 AerChemMIP simlation histSST-1950HC
================================================

The time indices in import_s1850_1950HC_gmxe.nml 
are set for a simulation start in Januar 1850.

The true simulation start is for January 1950.

When started from the restart files of the CMIP6 historical
simulation, as intended, the indeices work fine.

If you want to start the simulation as a 'cold start', the
indices of the import.nml have to be adapted. In this case
copy the original import_s1850_1950HC_gmxe.nml to 
import_s1950_1950HC_gmxe.nml and change the indices.
