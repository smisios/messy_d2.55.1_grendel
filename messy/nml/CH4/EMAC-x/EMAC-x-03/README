tracer_spin_up_v1 : I1H2O=H2OISOHHOvap and I2H2O=H2OISOHDOvap inconsistently, as H2OISO tracer in kg/kg_moistair

tracer_spin_up_v2 : Input of EMAC-x-03-su_0033_restart_0002....nc not appropriate

tracer_spin_up : As tracer_spin_up_v1 but with  I1H2O=H2O and I2H2O=HDO 
	       => H2OISO tracer will be initiallised by restart file from EMAC-x-02
	          H2O will be initialised by EMAC-x-02 => q by H2OISOHHOvap 
		  all water from same file
	       => CH4 will be initialised by earlier EMAC-x-03-su, alike to CH4_fx, Isotopologues I1/I2 
	          will be set onto CH4_D0 / D1 
		  consistent CH4 tracers
               => The isotopologue tracers (except I1/2H2O and I1/2CH4) are initialised with VSMOW
	       => All other tracers are initialised as in EMAC-x-03-su

lower boundary should be equal to fixed delta Value
