List of Set-ups

EMAC-x-01 : Simulation with OH field provided by EMPA

EMAC-x-02 : Simulation with OH field from ESCiMo simulations

EMAC-x-03 : Simulation with interactive chemistry (i.e. feedback on OH)


TODO:
====
1) start EMAC-x-01-su and  EMAC-x-02-su (10 years spinup)

   for x-02[-su]:
   - copy xmessy_mmd.EMAC-x-01[-su] and modify 
     - EXP_NAME (WORKDIR) ...
     - NML_SETUP



2) use tracer_gp restart files as initial file(s) for
   EMAC-x-01 and EMAC-x-02, respectively (tracer_s1990.nml !!!)

3) compile meccanism with CCMI-base-02-ISO.bat

4) EMAC-x-03 will be started with first spin-up of EMAC-x-02
