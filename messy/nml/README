The subdirectories with specific setups must contain
self-consistent sets of namelist files of all submodels involved.

The namelist file for switching the MESSy submodels ON / OFF is required:
   switch.nml

The namelist files of the generic submodels are required:
   channel.nml
   tracer.nml
   qtimer.nml
   timer.nml
   import.nml
   tendency.nml (if configured with --enable-MESSYTENDENCY)

If MMD is involved,
   mmd2way.nml
is also required.

The namelist file(s) for the chosen basemodel(s) are required, e.g.,
   ECHAM5302_${ECHAM5_HRES}${ECHAM5_VRES}.nml  (including nudging namelist !)

Further, since in ECHAM5 AEROPT, CLOUD, CLOUDOPT, CONVECT, ORBIT, RAD
SURFACE, E5VDIFF, OROGW and GWAVE (the latter for MA setups) are usually NOT 
switched off, also the respective namelist files are required:
   aeropt.nml
   cloud.nml
   cloudopt.nml
   convect.nml
   e5vdiff.nml
   gwave.nml
   orbit.nml
   orogw.nml
   rad.nml
   surface.nml

If tracers are to be transported, CVTRANS should be used for convective tracer
transport:
   cvtrans.nml

NOTES:
 1)  The subdirectory EXAMPLES does not contain a complete, working setup,
     but rather exemplary  namelist files for individual submodels.
 2)  The subdirectoy DEFAULTS contains some namelist files which are unlikely
     to be changed, except for very specific studies.
 3)  'Old' namelist files need to be modified w.r.t. the run-script variables
      which are replaced by copynml, e.g.:
      ESH_LRESUME -> MSH_LRESUME
      HRES        -> ECHAM5_HRES
      VRES        -> ECHAM5_VRES
      LAMIP       -> ECHAM5_LAMIP
      LMIDATM     -> ECHAM5_LMIDATM      
 4)  'nudge.nml' does not exist anymore, its contents needs to be 
     appended to ECHAM5302_${ECHAM5_HRES}${ECHAM5_VRES}.nml
 5)  A pre-defined setup for "ECHAM5 only" is in subdirectory E5.
 6) Important:
     - lnox.nml   : scaling factors are resolution dependent
     - channel.nml: 5h output frequency not allowed for all resolutions
     - import.nml : correct time indices (in netCDF files) need to be set,
                    depending on the start date
     - tracer.nml : the tracer initialisation might depend on the start date
 7) For testing the consistency of the namelist setup some scripts are
    available in the messy/util subdirectory (check script headers for some
    more information):
    - check_trac_out.tcsh   to check the completeness of tracer output
                            redirection
    - check_import_ts.tcsh  to check the consistency of requested and imported
                            time series
    - check_import_rgt.tcsh to check the consistency of the import.nml with
                            its dependent (NCREGRID) namelist files 
                            (import/*.nml) and the corresponding netCDF files
    - check_objects.tcsh    to check the availability of requested objects
                            (delivered by import.nml) as requested by
                            TNUDGE, OFFEMIS, ONEMIS, CH4
                            Note: this script requires check_import_rgt.tcsh
 8) HOWTO update NML-SETUPS from rad4all to rad:
    a) switch.nml: comment USE_RAD4ALL=.TRUE.
                   activate USE RAD=.TRUE.
                   activate USE_AEROPT
                   activate USE_CLOUDOPT
                   activate USE_ORBIT
    b) - link aeropt.nml   to DEFAULTS/aeropt.nml
       - link cloudopt.nml to DEFAULTS/cloudopt.nml
       - link orbit.nml    to DEFAULTS/orbit.nml (instead of orbit_old.nml)
    c) translate rad4all.nml into rad.nml
    d) import.nml: add ozone climatology (e.g.,Fortuin&Kelder), if required  
    e) grep all *nml for "-i rad4all" and "ECHAM5" 
       and modify for rad accordingly;
       Note: Theses objects are not longer available in channel 'ECHAM5':
             relo3     --
             cossza    (now orbit)
             albedo    (now rad)
             zi0       (now rad)
             trflw     (now rad01)
             trfli     (now rad01)
             soflw     (now rad01)
             sofli     (now rad01)
             flxs      (now rad01)
             flxt      (now rad01)
 9) HOWTO update NML-SETUPS from submodel H2O-usage to direct feedback:
    a) tracer*nml:
       &CPL
        !...
        ! initialize specific humidity ('q') with input variable 'H2O' and 
        ! convert from mol/mol into kg/kg (option 1)
        ini_pvar(1) = 'ECHAM5','q','H2O',1,
        !...
       /
       (of from qm1 with option 0 (no unit conversion))
    b) switch*nml:
       &CTRL
        !...
        !!$USE_H2O=.TRUE.
        !...
       /
    c) mecca*nml, e4chem*nml, ch4*nml:
       &CPL
        ! ...
        i_H2O_feedback = 1
        ! ...
       /
    d) [optional; e.g., for stratobud, mm for QCTM, etc.] channel*nml:
       ...
       ADD_REF(...)       = 'ECHAM5',   'qm1',        'tr_O3_sbud', '',
       etc.
       ...
