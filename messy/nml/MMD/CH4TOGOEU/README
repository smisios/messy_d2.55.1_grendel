Set-Up for the analysis simulation for the METHANE-TO-GO-EUROPE campaign. Set-up was branched of from MMD/FC/CH4TOGOEU. 
Four instances, down to ~2.8km over South-Eastern Europe
EMAC uses full chemistry (CCMI-base-02.bat mechanism needed)
The COSMO/MESSy instances use parameterized chemistry for CH4 and SO2.
