01 -> ECHAM5
02 -> CORDEX EAST ASIA (0.44°) 
04 -> East Asia small (0.1°)
03 -> EU large (0.44°)
05 -> EU small (0.1°)


The set-Up is uses for the EU_ASIA simulation (Markus Killian) and the emerge4 simulation für the EMeRGe-ASIA Campaign.
The following mechanisms are needed:
CCMI-base-01-tag.bat            
CCMI-base-01-tag-ch3cn.bat 


If ch3cn is used, the according offemis and airsea namelists needs to be used.
CH3CN emissions are only used for biomass burning by scaling of CO emissions with 0.02
