abstract = {The development of a comprehensive Earth System Model (ESM) to study the interactions between chemical, physical, and biological processes, requires coupling of the different domains (land, ocean, atmosphere, ...). One strategy is to link existing domain-specific models with a universal coupler, i.e. an independent standalone program organizing the communication between other programs. In many cases, however, a much simpler approach is more feasible. We have developed the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). It comprises (1) a modular interface structure to connect to a , (2) an extendable set of such for miscellaneous processes, and (3) a coding standard. MESSy is therefore not a coupler in the classical sense, but exchanges data between a and several within one comprehensive executable. The internal complexity of the is controllable in a transparent and user friendly way. This provides remarkable new possibilities to study feedback mechanisms (by two-way coupling). Note that the MESSy and the coupler approach can be combined. For instance, an atmospheric model implemented according to the MESSy standard could easily be coupled to an ocean model by means of an external coupler. The vision is to ultimately form a comprehensive ESM which includes a large set of submodels, and a base model which contains only a central clock and runtime control. This can be reached stepwise, since each process can be included independently. Starting from an existing model, process submodels can be reimplemented according to the MESSy standard. This procedure guarantees the availability of a state-of-the-art model for scientific applications at any time of the development. In principle, MESSy can be implemented into any kind of model, either global or regional. So far, the MESSy concept has been applied to the general circulation model ECHAM5 and a number of process boxmodels.},

abstract = {The Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) is an open, multi-institutional project providing a strategy for developing comprehensive Earth System Models (ESMs) with highly flexible complexity. The first version of the MESSy infrastructure and process submodels, mainly focusing on atmospheric chemistry, has been successfully coupled to an atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM) expanding it into an Atmospheric Chemistry GCM (AC-GCM) for nudged simulations and into a Chemistry Climate Model (CCM) for climate simulations. Here, we present the second development cycle of MESSy, which comprises (1) an improved and extended infrastructure for the basemodel independent coupling of process-submodels, (2) new, highly valuable diagnostic capabilities for the evaluation with observational data and (3) an improved atmospheric chemistry setup. With the infrastructural changes, we place the headstone for further model extensions from a CCM towards a comprehensive ESM. The new diagnostic submodels will be used for regular re-evaluations of the continuously further developing model system. The updates of the chemistry setup are briefly evaluated.},

abstract = {We present the submodels DRYDEP and SEDI for the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). Dry deposition of gases and aerosols is calculated within DRYDEP, whereas SEDI deals with aerosol particle sedimentation. Dry deposition velocities depend on the near-surface turbulence and the physical and chemical properties of the surface cover (e.g. the roughness length, soil pH or leaf stomatal exchange). The dry deposition algorithm used in DRYDEP is based on the big leaf approach and is described in detail within this Technical Note. The sedimentation submodel SEDI contains two sedimentation schemes: a simple upwind zeroth order scheme and a first order approach.},

abstract = {The ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model is coupled to the ocean general circulation model MPIOM using the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) interface. MPIOM is operated as a MESSy submodel, thus the need of an external coupler is avoided. The coupling method is tested for different model configurations, proving to be very flexible in terms of parallel decomposition and very well load balanced. The run-time performance analysis and the simulation results are compared to those of the COSMOS (Community earth System MOdelS) climate model, using the same configurations for the atmosphere and the ocean in both model systems. It is shown that our coupling method shows a comparable run-time performance to the coupling based on the OASIS (Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil, version 3) coupler. The standard (CMIP3) climate model simulations performed with EMAC-MPIOM show that the results are comparable to those of other Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation models.},

@article{Wetzel2005,
abstract = {Trends and variability in the ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux and the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 are simulated for the period 1948-2003, using a biogeochemical carbon cycle model (HAMOCC5) coupled online to a global ocean general circulation model (MPI-OM). The model is forced by daily National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data from 1948 to 2003. We find a global interannual variability of +/- 0.50 PgC yr(-1) (2 sigma) which is largely dominated by ocean dynamics in the equatorial Pacific. On decadal scale, two patterns are of global importance. First, the regime shift that occurs in 1975-1977 when the modeled interannual variability of the equatorial Pacific changes from +/- 0.32 PgC yr(-1) to +/- 0.23 PgC yr(-1) and the mean outgasing of CO2 decreases from 0.70 PgC yr(-1) to 0.58 PgC yr(-1). Second, the trend that occurs in the Southern Ocean, where we find an increase of the CO2 fluxes over the full 56-year simulation period. The flux results from stronger upwelling and deeper mixed layers which are caused by increasing wind velocities. We estimate an average CO2 flux into the ocean of 1.49 PgC yr(-1) for 1980-1989 and 1.74 PgC yr(-1) for 1990-1999, with extremes of 1.20 PgC yr(-1) at the La Nina event in 1996 and 2.10 PgC yr(-1) during the El Nino events in 1993 and 1998. Because of the rising buffer factor, the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is slowing down in regions of shallow mixing toward the end of the simulation. Overall, about 124 Pg of anthropogenic carbon has accumulated in the model ocean until the end of 2003.},
