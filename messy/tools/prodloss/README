A note of caution:
==================

Usage: prodloss.exe < prodloss.nml

Option 1: 
=========
- Apply prodloss to original equation file (gas.eqn) with full mechanism.
  In this case, the program analyses the mechanism BEFORE replacement files are
  applied! This requires a manual completion of equations (in diag.tex), which
  are subject to replacements, because reaction numbers will be modified
  by replacements, for instance:
  <G4504> --> <G4504a> (both need to be included in the diag.tex file!

Option 2:
=========
- Apply prodloss to the equation file which includes
  already the desired replacements (mecca.eqn). In this case
  1) create your desired mechanism including replacements (!) with your
     batch-file (messy/mbm/caaba/mecca/batch/*)
  2) run prodloss with the resulting mecca.eqn
  3) move the diag.tex file (output of prodloss) with an appropriate name
     into messy/mbm/caaba/mecca/diagtrac
  4) include this renamed tex-file in your batch-file (see 1)
  5) recreate your mechanism, now INCULDING the prodloss-diagnostics
