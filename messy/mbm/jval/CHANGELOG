14 (2014-09-24) THIS VERSION IS PUBLISHED IN GMD

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- messy_jval.f90: Bug fix for index i0. At very high altitudes, dlv2 can
  be smaller than 44.5 and the resulting index i0 was out of the valid
  range. It is now set to i0=1:
  i0(j,k)  = MAX(1,MIN(58,INT(AINT((dlv2(j,k)-44.5)/0.2) + 1.00001)))
- GLYOX, CH3COCH3, MVK, MGLYOX, MACR: pressure dependence mentioned in
  *.nml files

******************************************************************************

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- JVPP files with math tools renamed:
  messy_main_lsq.f90    -> messy_main_math_lsq.f90
  messy_main_spline.f90 -> messy_main_math_spline.f90 
- JVAL and JVPP user manual moved from outside into the manual/ directory
- njv, main.mk, _zipjval.tcsh: updated to bring into line with
  corresponding caaba files (ncv, main.mk, _zipcaaba.tcsh)

******************************************************************************

13 (2013-10-14)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- SO2.sig and SO2.nml with data from Danielache et al. (2008) added
- DP added to JVAL box model
- bugfix for HCHO: Temperature dependence increased by a factor of 10
  because of error in Table 2 of Meller and Moortgat (2000).

CHANGES by Patrick Joeckel:
- jvpp_step1.f90: NMAXWAV = 5000 is now the maximum size for the input
  spectrum. Error check introduced.

12 (2013-03-11)

- bugfix for CO2: now using the original data from Shemansky (ref2346)
- bugfix for N2O5: see jvpp_step2.f90

******************************************************************************

11 (2013-02-07)

- from now on, the same version number is used for JVAL and JVPP
- JVAL:
  - JVPP directory moved from messy/tools/ to messy/mbm/jval/
  - SX preprocesser directives removed
  - cleanup of SUBROUTINE aero_2d: only 1...7 as a loop, dont calc 8
    then overwrite it with i_ref(j) = MIN(i_ref(j),7)
  - now using the automatically generated include file from JVPP
  - DP added for cdisse in SUBROUTINE jval_solar_time_control
  - messy_jval_si.f90, jval.nml: 'O3ubc' instead of 'jval' for RG_TRIG
- JVPP:
  - temperature dependence for O3 added (dat_lit/spectra/O3.s2t)
  - for J(O2), JPL-2011 only has data for >= 205 nm; data from Koppers &
    Murtagh is only used for <= 201.01 nm; simple fix for gap in
    interpolation added
  - C3O2 added
  - NO3NOO deleted. It is probably not important, not used in MECCA
    anymore, and JPL2011 has no recommendation for the quantum yield.
  - SO2 deleted. It is not used in MECCA, and it is unclear how the
    numbers were derived. JPL2011 has no recommendation in note I1.
  - CS2 deleted. It is not used in MECCA, and it is unclear how the
    numbers were derived. Using the Xu&Joens spectrum, JVPP produces
    parameters that are a factor of about 1E4 larger that those that are
    now in JVAL.
  - ClNO2 from Ghosh et al. (ref2693)

******************************************************************************

10 (2012-05-23)

- step 1: interpolation method changed to "integration". This is
  especially necessary for OClO, BrO and IO with many peaks.
- inputdir = dat_m17 or dat_lit defined via namelist and used for
  calculation of quantum yield phi in step2
- quantum yield calculations for MGLYOX, CH3COCH3, MACR, MVK, and GLYOX
  in SUBROUTINE calc_phi deleted because these species are hardcoded
  anyway. If the code is needed again, it should be recovered from
  version 09.
- quantum yield calculation for CH3CHO in SUBROUTINE calc_phi deleted
  because it is now read from dat/spectra/CH3CHO.phi
- using JVPP-generated code fixes the missing parentheses bug for PAN
  and CFCl3 (emails from RS to ML and PJ, 2009-01-30), e.g.:
  wrong:
  SIG_PAN(1) = &
    P1(c1_PAN(1),c1_PAN(2),tnorm(j,k))* &
    P1(B1_1_PAN(i1(j,k)),A1_1_PAN(i1(j,k)),v3_du1(j,k)) + &
    P1(B1_2_PAN(i1(j,k)),A1_2_PAN(i1(j,k)),v3_du1(j,k)) * v2s_m(j,k)
  correct:
  SIG_PAN(1) = &
    P1(c1_PAN(1),c1_PAN(2),tnorm(j,k))* &
    (P1(B1_1_PAN(i1(j,k)),A1_1_PAN(i1(j,k)),v3_du1(j,k)) + &
    P1(B1_2_PAN(i1(j,k)),A1_2_PAN(i1(j,k)),v3_du1(j,k)) * v2s_m(j,k))

******************************************************************************

09 (2011-10-19)

- quantum yields calculated in SUBROUTINE calc_phi are written to *.phi
  output files

- C3O2 added
- jvpp_read_nml.f90 deleted and contents moved into jvpp_step3.f90
- jvpp_step3.f90: jrow deleted and jval_gp renamed to jval_2d, as in new
  JVAL version 2.5.

******************************************************************************

- this is the last version that includes the subroutines
  write_nml_spectra_m17 and write_nml_spectra_lit

******************************************************************************

04 (2009-02-10)

- phi files (quantum yields) added to spectra/
- all files moved to $E2/messy/tools/jvpp/
- starting from spectra_sig_static, step1 now creates spectra_176 which
  is identical to spectra_176_static (except for CH2O.s2t_176,
  NO3.s2t_176, and O3.s3t_176 because of non-standard names)
- step1 now also works for tdep files (now called s2t and s3t)

        ../spectra_eff/ instead of result/
