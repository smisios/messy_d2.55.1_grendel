  example_readj.nc -> example_input_readj.nc
  - "input_" instead of "init_" refers to input throughout the model run
    and not just initial values at the start
  - the term "input_readj" is now in the code as well as in the example
    input filename

  tr -d '\015' < tmp_caaba.log >> caaba.log
  rm tmp_caaba.log
  This also solves the problem that tee (for still unknown reasons)
  suppressed runtime error messages.

caaba_3.8d (2016-06-15)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- messy_semidep_box.f90: new SUBROUTINE injection

CHANGES by Hella Riede
- general:
  - Relative humidity and specific humidity are now available throughout CAABA
    and if necessary interconverted. Of the two, specific humidity
    is the more robust variable of humidity as relative humidity can have
    various definitions (traditional p(H2O)/psat or WMO w/wsat), various
    parameterizations for psat, and can be defined over liquid below freezing
    temperature if supercooling is allowed). Functions that use humidity as
    input (cair, conversion between humidity and c(H2O)) now use the
    unambiguous specific humidity variable spechum, which can always be
    derived from relhum by rel2spechum, taking all of the above considerations
    for relative humidity into account.
- manual/caaba_mecca_manual.tex:
  - adapted text about 'Tracer initialization file'
  - added stime, time variable in init_spec to table of external variables
  - adapted text about humidities
- messy_main_tools.f90:
  - new functions cair_c (calculate cair taking water vapor concentration into
    account) and cair_q (calculate cair taking specific humidity into account)
    replace cair_wmo and cair_trad; use rel2spechum if necessary to convert
    relative humidity to specific humidity, which takes the peculiarities of
    relhum (see 'general' into account
  - new function mr2spechum to calculate spechum and relhum from c(H2O) in
    case l_ignore_relhum=TRUE
  - rh2mr, relhum2mr, and relhumwmo2mr obsolete, use spechum2mr, if needed
    in combination with rel2spechum, which deals with psat parameterizations
    and various definitions
  - rel2spechum and rel2spechumwmo functions merged into one function
    rel2spechum with additional optional parameter l_relhum_wmo;
    new status meanings: 1 = warning, 2 = error
  - spec2relhum and spec2relhumwmo functions merged into one function
    spec2relhum with additional optional parameter l_relhum_wmo;
    new status meanings: 1 = warning, 2 = error
  - spec2relhum: reduced number of cases catching invalid specific humidity
    values, avoiding float equality test
  - spec2relhum and rel2spechum: optional parameter z_l_psat_liquid to
    calculate relative humidity and saturation water vapor pressure always
    over liquid surface, independent of temperature
- caaba_io_ascii.inc:
  - created subroutines open_output_file_1d and write_output_file_1d (copies
    of open_output_file and write_output_file) to be consistent with
    caaba_io_netcdf
- caaba_io_netcdf.inc:
  - new subroutine open_output_file_1d for true 1-D files without dimensions
    lon, lat, lev; dimension variables lon and lat were blocking the
    respective names for the trajectory lon and lat variables; now, trajectory
    variables in messy_traject_box can be written out as lon and lat instead
    of lon_tr and lat_tr
  - introduced necessary analogous variables for *_1d subroutines
- messy_traject_box.f90:
  - traject_ physc: calculate cair from c(H2O) if l_ignore_relhum=TRUE
  - rename LON_TR to LON, and LAT_TR to LAT in trajectory-mode output file
    caaba_messy.nc
  - call calc_sza after get_physc_data (part of traject_physc in messy_physc),
    when trajectory variables like longitude have been updated to end of
    integration time step; increment model_time by timesteplen determined
    in get_physc_data before call to calc_sza, then decrement again as
    model_time is globally incremented in PROGRAM caaba in caaba.f90
    -> consistency between longitude and localtime written to output
    file caaba_messy.nc; in TRAJECT mode all variables are written out for
    the end of the time step (not for the beginning of the time step)
  - traject_init
    - call calc_sza and determine local time for first time point
    - always write out relhum and spechum; before: spechum only written
      out if given instead of relhum along trajectory
  - traject_result
    - write out cossza and locall time variables for first time point as well
    - always write out relhum and spechum; before: spechum only written
      out if given along trajectory instead of relhum
- messy_jval_box.f90:
  - renamed zfac to jfac, see point below
  - write out jval scaling factor (jfac, jscalfac) if j-values scaled by
    external J_NO2: jscalfac = external J_NO2 / original J_NO2;
    if no scaling due to thresholds, then value 1 written out
- caaba.f90:
  - if l_ignore_relhum=TRUE, use c(H2O) to update relhum, spechum, and cair
    in x0
  - always convert relhum to spechum (and spechum to relhum if spechum is
    given), using the revised functions spec2relhum and rel2spechum
  - use new function cair_q, calculating cair from spechum, which is
    independent from the psat parameterization and from the definition
    of relhum (WMO or traditional)
  - make l_groundhogday a namelist Boolean, added to caaba_mem
  - new l_freezetime namelist Boolean, added to caaba_mem
  - if l_steady_state_stop true, solar zenith angle (SZA) is NOT kept
    constant automatically anymore -> use instead independent Boolean
    l_freezetime or l_groundhogday in namelist
  - calc_sza renamed to time_control as it handles much more than calculating
    SZA
  - part of subroutine time_control dealing with calculating SZA moved to
    messy_main_timer as subroutine calc_sza
  - introduced enhancement factor 'efact' to scale photolysis rates
    from SAPPHO
  - added scenario CUMULUS (inside cumulonimbus cloud)
  - added scenario MOHALI (Mohali October condition)
  - adapted information output about runtime when in steady-state mode
  - write out SZA also for sirst time step if in trajectory mode
- caaba_mem.f90:
  - added CHARACTER stime: time variable name of init_spec netCDF file
  - added REAL efact, photolysis enhancement factor
  - added Boolean l_groundhogday, repeat first model day
  - added Boolean l_freezetime, freeze model time to first time point
  - added Boolean l_psat_liquid, saturation vapor pressure always over liquid?
- nodiag.tcsh: comments and info output; new switch to remove Monte-Carlo
  factors from mecca.eqn for comparison
- messy_main_timer.f90:
  - new function calc_sza, calculating solar zenith angle based on time and
    longitude
- messy_mecca.f90:
  - steady state:
    - more general formulation of steady-state criterion, defining tracers
      can be more easily changed
    - catch case where old and new concentrations compared for steady state
      are (close to) zero -> relative change undefined -> set relative
      change to zero
    - use average of old and new value in denominator when calculating
      relative change to catch cases where only new or only old value
      (close to) zero
    - print information to caaba.log how close to steady state
    - old function is kept as steady_state_reached_old
- messy_main_control_cb.f90:
  - 'End day' and 'runtime' values printed according to whether steady
    state mode or not
- messy_mecca_box.f90:
  - new ability: init_spec time axis considered if more than one time point
    present; in that case, mixing ratios are interpolated to model_start time;
    convenient to bundle init values at different times into one init_spec
    file, e.g., initializing from mixing ratios along a trajectory
  - when external chemical tracer initialization overwrites values from x0,
    the warning is now issued in the same line
  - use cair_c, mr2spechum and spec2relhum to calculate humidities from c(H2O)
    if l_ignore_relhum=TRUE
  - use spechum2mr instead of rh2mr, relhum2mr, or relhumwmo2mr; fewer USE
    statements and logicals needed + specific humidity has no issues with
    psat parameterization or definition, which is all dealt with in
    spec2relhum and rel2spechum (messy_main_tools); relhum
    is automatically converted to spechum throughout CAABA
  - added chemistry initialization scenario x0_cumulus
  - use l_hum_emac, l_relhum_wmo, and l_ignore_relhum from caaba_mem for
    whole module, not single subroutines
- messy_sappho.f90:
  - added enhancement factor 'efact' to scale photolysis rates, e.g., to
    describe enhancement of photolysis rates within clouds
  - added photolysis scenario photo_cumulus
- messy_sappho_box.f90:
  - write out acetone j-value (J_CH3COCH3)
  - use 'efact' from caaba_mem to call jvalues function
- messy_semidep_box.f90: added emission scenario emission_cumulus
- nml:
  - added file caaba_cumulus.nml
  - added Boolean l_freezetime
  - added Boolean l_groundhogday
  - added Boolean l_psat_liquid
  - renamed l_psat_emac to l_hum_emac and changed scope: l_hum_emac=T
    makes cair_c and cair_q calculations consistent with messy_mecca_si.f90
    (old name: messy_mecca_e5.f90), and switches psat to be calculated by
    EMAC functions tlucua and tlucuaw

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- exitviewport.jnl: plt2pdf replaced by plt_mergeto_pdf
- main.mk: ">&" replaced by ">" in forcheck target to avoid
  "Syntax error: Bad fd number"
  when using dash instead of sh.
- replace.awk, substitute.awk: Regarding deletion of reactions via a
  *.rpl file, if the last character of the reaction number is a "*", it
  is now treated as a wildcard. For example, "<G300*>" can be used to
  refer to several reactions.
- _zipcaaba excludes version control directory .git/
- xmecca: do not show batch files in user_contributed/ because this
  would list too many files. If a file from user_contributed/ is needed,
  it should be linked into the main batch directory:
  cd mecca/batch ; ln -s user_contributed/myfile.bat .

- user manual updated

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.5b (2013-04-18)

CHANGES by Hella Riede:
- bug fix in template_messy_mecca_kpp.f90, necessary for gfortran: FIX
  and VAR are part of the C array via EQUIVALENCE. Since C is already
  PRIVATE, they must also be PRIVATE.
- Makefile: settings for gfortran added
- xcaaba: Improved treatment for choosing the name of the output directory

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.5 (2013-03-14)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:

- MECCA:
  - gas_mim1.eqn: function uef (uncertainty estimate function,
    approximated by 3rd order polynomial, for G7603) added

- CAABA (messy_mecca_box.f90, messy_main_control_cb.f90):
  exclude radjimt with dau-ngrade directives for dau-ngrading
  (this is required only temporary, as long as RADJIMT uses (non-conform!)
  CMAT; the latter dependence cannot yet be avoided so easily ...

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.4b (2013-02-20)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- index added to CAABA/MECCA manual

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.4 (2013-02-07)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- rate coefficients updated to JPL-2011 (ref2626)
- xcaaba, xmecca, montecarlo.tcsh, ncv, xgraphviz, nodiag.tcsh,
  tag/xselectcfg: Substitution now in standard syntax with slashes,
  e.g.: s/OLD/NEW/g
- gas.eqn: The second path of J(N2O5) (<J3104b> to NO + O) is switched
  off. JPL2011 recommends a quantum yield qy=0 for lambda > 300 nm but
  has no recommendation for lambda <= 300 nm
- Makefile: version 0.9 of g95 not supported anymore
- bugfix in messy_cmn_gasaq.f90: alpha(BrCl)=0.038, not 0.38
- bug fixes in messy_mecca_aero.f90 to avoid undefined dummy values:
  - SUBROUTINE mecca_aero_calc_k_ex:
    - no calculation if molar_mass(jn)<=0
    - calculate accommodation coefficients alpha only if alpha_T0(jn) > 0
  - SUBROUTINE mecca_aero_calc_k_ex_ocean:
    - do not use INTENT(OUT) for k_exf and k_exb because that will
      undefine the values for other aerosol bins. Instead, use
      INTENT(INOUT).
- bugfix in main.mk for gmake zipall
- bugfix in rxnrates_scaled.jnl: caaba_mecca.nc changed to caaba_mecca_rr.nc
- caaba.f90: new subroutines dilute and dilute_once which dilute air in
  a plume by adding fresh air to it (e.g. for volcanic plumes)
- multirun/input/example_*.txt: temperature now in [K], not Celsius
- messy_jval_box.f90: the scenarios FREE_TROP and HOOVER now also use
  the photo_mbl subroutine, which should be okay because the level is
  automatically selected from the pressure via nn_index
- caaba_mbl.nml: now using photrat_channel = 'jval'
- caaba_free_trop.nml: now using JVAL and photo_scenario = 'MBL'

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.3 (2012-01-13)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- xcaaba, xmecca and elsewhere: for compatibility with AIX, all sed
  substitution commands in shell scripts are now written as "s/old/new/"
  instead of "s|old|new|".
- gas.eqn:
  fudge factor 1.4 removed from J6100. The J-value from JVAL is now
  based on JPL2011.
- multirun.tcsh: default unit for temperature in input file is now [K]
  and not [Celsius] anymore
- messy_mecca.f90: in SUBROUTINE initialize_kpp_variables, check that
  ind_*<=NVAR when referring to atol(ind_*) to prevent error when these
  species are fixed and their ind_* is between NVAR and NSPEC.
- messy_readj_box.f90: bugfix in readj_init to use init_j_index correctly
- o3orig.bat and react4c.bat moved into user_contributed/
- bugfix in jval.jnl: renamed CH3COCHO --> MGLYOX and PAA --> CH3CO3H

- added energy release for reactions (kJmol)
- messy_e4chem_box.f90: small fix

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- xmecca: sed command adding "USE messy_cmn_photol_mem" to
  messy_mecca_kpp.f90 removed because KP4 does this via
  kp4/templates/module_header
- *.bat: activation of kJ/mol in gas.eqn is now controlled via "set
  enthalpy = y/n" in batch files
- messy_mecca_box.f90: fill routines added for define different
  temperatures (temp_elec and temp_ion) and branch
- RADJIMT: new photolysis submodel, with input data in input/radjimt/

CHANGES by Rolf Sander and Hella Riede:
- TRAJECT: variable vtime determines the name of the time variable in
  input files (analogous to vlon, vlat, etc.)

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.1 (2011-05-10)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- update to MESSy d2.41
- scripts psmerge, plt2pdf and double_line_widths copied into jnl/tools

******************************************************************************

caaba_3.0beta (2010-12-08)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- Makefile: ADDEFS = $(DEFOPT)E4CHEM commented out
- most *.bat moved into batch/user_contributed/ directory
- some *.nml moved into nml/user_contributed/ directory
- the example file nml/caaba_example.nml now contains explanations of
  all namelist variables. Comments from other *.nml (partially already
  outdated) have been removed.
- messy_mecca_box.f90: "CALL x0" in mecca_init is now executed _before_
  defining c(ind_H2O) as a function of relative humidity. This ensures
  that c(ind_H2O) cannot be not overwritten by H2O data in the init_spec
  input file. For model runs in which the relative humidity should _not_
  be used to calculate c(ind_H2O), the namelist variable l_ignore_relhum
  should be set to TRUE.

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- xmecca:
  - show a list of batch files to select from
  - info about SETFIX added to logfile
- bugfix in steady_state_reached() in messy_mecca.f90: timesteplen is now
  a function parameter (INTENT(IN)) and not obtained via USE.
- messy_main_control_cb.f90: runtime inconsistency check may result in a
  false positive for numerical reasons. Therefore it is restricted to
  USE_TRAJECT where it really may be useful.
- caaba.f90:
  - write exit status for caaba.exe ("0"=okay or "1"=error) to
    status.log and check status in xcaaba, multirun.tcsh and
    montecarlo.tcsh
  - test that 0 < relhum < 1.1
- some files renamed according to the general CAABA/MECCA programming
  guidelines:
  asc2ferret4nc.tcsh -> xtxt2nc
  asc2ferret4nc.awk  -> txt2nc.awk

  giving the user a message to use doubling instead. Doubling works OK.
  The test configuration for 13CH4 (tagTEST.cfg) was added.

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- new scenarios HOOVER and LAB_C15 added
- some variable names changed to make them more consistent in the nml
  files and the f90 code:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  old:                          new:                            where:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  time_step     (STRING)       -> time_step_str                    nml
  time_step_len (REAL,seconds) -> time_step                        f90
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  ext_runtime   (STRING)       -> runtime_str                      nml
  runtime       (REAL,seconds) -> runtime          (unchanged)     f90
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  startday      (REAL,days)    -> model_start_day                  nml
  model_start   (REAL,seconds) -> model_start      (unchanged)     f90
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
- new section "How to enlarge KPP" added to manual
- ncv: update meccalit.bib via findrefs.awk
- xcaaba and xmecca: echo "\n" replaced by 2 echo commands
- _zipcaaba.tcsh: the generated zip file includes all example input
  files which are now called example*.nc
- new namelist switch l_ignore_relhum. If true, relhum is not used to
  calculate c(H2O). Instead, H2O should be initialized in subroutine x0
  (either directly or via 'External chemical initialization')

******************************************************************************

caaba_2.7c (2010-09-02)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- messy_main_tools.f90: the new subroutine rh2mr is a wrapper for
  choosing between relhum2mr and relhumwmo2mr

CHANGES by Hella Riede
- messy_traject_box:
  - using cair/cair_old to correct concentrations along trajectory, not
    combination of old and new temperatures now that cair is more complex
    and involves CAABA water vapor mixing ratio or psat and relhum
  - spec2relhum and spec2relhumwmo used to convert to relhum if spechum
    given by trajectory file
  - update_trajectory renamed to traject_physc; udating really done by
    get_physc_data and in traject_physc only update_trajectory was called
    old: traject_physc -> update_trajectory -> get_physc_data
    new: traject_physc (before update_trajectory) -> get_physc_data
  - cair now calculated in traject_init and traject_physc
- caaba.f90:
  - calling init_convect_tables if using l_psat_emac
  - using cair_wmo and cair_trad to calculate cair
- messy_mecca_box:
  - using messy_main_tools function rh2mr to convert from relhum to
    mixing ratio in mecca_init and mecca_physc
- messy_main_tools:
  - new functions relhum2mr and relhumwmo2mr: convert relative humidity to
    mixing ratio; generic, but right now only needed in CAABA
    since all humidity via relhum or relhumwmo
  - corrected all functions involving spechum, relhum, psat to account for
    press being pressure of HUMID atmosphere
  - noticed that psat < 0 between roughly 211.4 K and 187 K, which is
    reached in UTLS; now using recommended functions from Murphy and
    Koop, QJRMS, 2005: psat_mk (ice below 273.15, analogous to tlucua
    from init_convect_tables) and psat_mk(l_liquid=T) (above liquid
    water, analogous to tlucuaw; both converge to zero with decreasing
    temperature, always > 0
  - l_psat_emac: switch for alternative to psat_ice and psat_liq: use
    look-up tables from init_convect_tables in messy_main_tools.f90 to
    be consistent with EMAC; standard: psat_mk; init_convect_tables
    called from caaba.f90 is switch true
  - if simulation under supercooling effects wished when using
    spec2relhum and similar functions: always use psat_mk(l_liquid=T),
    analogous to tlucuaw
- free-troposphere tracer initialization; average of initial values from
  5-day back trajectories (T42 5h EMAC output) of CARIBIC2 flight
  20060706_CAN_FRA_157_EMAC
- messy_mecca_box and caaba.nml:
  WMO/standard relhum choice by namelist parameter
  l_relhum_wmo; default: standard relhum
  => spec2relhum, spec2relhum_wmo and rel2spechum now have
     one optional argument more: l_psat_emac
- eval_time_str:
  - both date formats, YYYY-MM-DD and DD-MONTH-YYYY accepted
  - string comparisons more secure by using ucase
  - (uncomfortable) flexibility for time origin in output:
    ![uni] label for lines to be active when time string is wished to be
    unified to the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss; ![sam] label for lines
    that should be active when time string should be written out as read in
- jval_box: note that j-values only corrected if jval j-value above
  threshold; was arbitrarily set to 1E-10 (to avoid large random ratios);
  now set to 2E-3, which is easily crossed after sunrise and at the same
  time less vulnerable to sampling artifacts dur to 5-hour output interval
- xmecca:
  - now inserts the default values ('n') into mecca.eqn when default is
    chosen for rxnrates and tagdbl
  - values of 'decomp' and 'kppoption' written to logfile also when NO batch
    file used
  - adds $HOST to infoline $timestamp
- xcaaba:
  - create variable $timestamp similar to xmecca; prepend to caaba.log

caaba_2.7b (2010-08-17)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- bugfix for gas_mim1.eqn: mcexp deleted
- reaction rates RR* are already divided by time_step_len in the f90
  code, thus they are not accumulated in the netcdf files anymore
- Monte-Carlo:
  - montecarlo.jnl: histograms of k and c added
- to avoid redundancy, changes are now only listed here but not in the
  caaba/mecca user manual anymore

caaba_2.4b (2008-05-29)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- CAABA can now be compiled and run with "OUTPUT = ASCII" in Makefile.
  This is useful to install CAABA on a machine without the netcdf
  library. However, subroutines that read from nc files cannot be used
  in that case, of course.
- messy_main_output renamed to messy_main_mbmio and moved to
  messy/smcl/. The corresponding netcdf and ascii code is contained in
  the include files messy_main_mbmio_ascii.inc and
  messy_main_mbmio_netcdf.inc.
- open_input_file moved from messy_traject_box.f90 to messy_main_mbmio
- close_output_file renamed to close_file because it is also used for
  input files
- messy_semidep_box.f90: different emissions are put into individual
  subsubroutines (emission_default, emission_oomph, ...)
- ncv split into ncv and zipcaaba
- xcaaba: model source code (*.f90, *.inc, *.spc, *.eqn) is also copied
  to output/ after the model run
- xmecca-generated infos are now available as f90 strings in
  messy_mecca_kpp(_global).f90. This works partially also for kp4,
  however, the integrator (integr) is not shown.
- xcaaba lists only the active lines of namelists before running caaba
- template to allow model stop at steady state:
  - FUNCTION steady_state_reached()
  - namelist variable l_steady_state_stop
- messy_mecca_box.f90:

  - if a command line parameter $1 exists, xmecca uses the shell
    variable definitions from batch/$1.bat (instead of interactive mode)
  - header of mecca.eqn now shows infos (e.g. $apn, $rplfile and $wanted)
  - header of kpp-generated *.f90 files shows several infos
- xcaaba:
  - command line parameter $1 is passed to xmecca

  if 'relhum' contains specific humidity, also adjusted in description
  in caaba.nml
- no l_spechum logical in caaba.nml anymore, automatic switch between relhum
  and spechum inside code
- model_start now also in caaba_mem to avoid several times conversion
  from seconds to days and back (e.g., percent_done)
- traject_init has to run before mecca_init so cair is right for chem spec init

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- rosenbrock_posdef.f90 adapted for kpp-2.2.1_rs: IERR_NAMES instead of
  IERR_NAME

    now in decomp/ subdirectory. xdecomp calls seddecomp_ros*
  - xkpp: default integrator = ros3
  - xkpp: bug fixed (confusion between sulfur "S" and stratospheric "St"
    reactions)

CHANGES by Benedikt Steil:
- Several scripts decomp/seddecomp_ros* to remove indirect indexing
  (preliminary).

CHANGES by Astrid Kerkweg:
- label Mbl included in xkpp and aerosol.eqn file

******************************************************************************

mecca_07 (2003-07-04)

- mecca.spc divided into gas.spc and aerosol.spc

- all species defined as VARIABLES

- some species changed to FIXED in mecca.k

- constants changed from 1d0 to 1E0 etc.

******************************************************************************

mecca_06 (2003-06-23)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- driver.f90 is now a dummy file. The contents of it has been moved to
  mo_mz_mecca_e5.f90.
- new awk script tracdef.awk extracts all KPP_XXX from
  mo_mz_kpp_gdata.f90 and inserts these species into mz_idt.f90. For all
  KPP_XXX that are not zero it also inserts the species into
  mz_conc2mr.f90, mz_mr2conc.f90, and mz_trac.f90, using the tracer info
  in tracdef.tex. xkpp starts tracdef.awk and then moves the new files
  to the include/ directory.
- aerosol.eqn: temp is now a parameter of farr2()
- gas.eqn:
  - Khet() is now a 4-d array
  - new filenames for USE statements: e.g. mo_mz_mecca_kpp_mem
- xkpp: radau5 added; using kpp version v1.1-f90-devel now

******************************************************************************

mecca_05 (2003-05-22)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- halogen and aerosol chemistry added (gas.eqn and aerosol.eqn)
- xkpp:
  - some info about the selection etc. added to beginning of mo_mz_kpp.f90
  - mecca.eqn is added to mo_mz_kpp.f90
- using kpp version v1.1-f90-alpha6 now
- mecca-all.eqn renamed to gas.eqn

******************************************************************************

mecca_04 (2002-12-23)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- this version was used for echam5.1.04_mz03
- kpp now gets information about rate constants from kpp_interface
- additional submodels only need to add one line to #INLINE F95_RCONST, e.g.:
  USE mo_mz_modstr_kpp_interface

******************************************************************************

mecca_03 (2002-11-25)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- this version was used for echam5.1.04_mz02i
- new shell script xkpp that selects wanted reactions and runs kpp
- correct labels {%...} added to mecca-all.eqn
- gas-phase reaction N2O5 + H2O deactivated
- CH3O replaced  with HCHO + HO2
- products O2, N2, and CO2 deleted because they are fixed species
- heterogeneous chemistry from smeili
- reaction numbers (not yet for halogen reactions)
- updated rate constant for N2+O1D and for CO+OH

- note added on 2010-03-17: gas.eqn was updated in this version,
  probably with new MIM chemistry from RvK. For example, the coefficient
  for ACETOL + hv was changed from 0.11 to 0.074

******************************************************************************

mecca_02 (2002-11-12)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- upgrade to kpp version 1.1-f90-alpha5:
  - indices kpp_* for array C() are defined (independent of NVARST etc.)
  - unused kpp dummy species get a value of kpp_* = 0
  - i_* should not be used anymore
- rate constants updated with mecca-all-psc.eqn from smeili (original
  psc eqn files are also included in mecca_02.zip)

******************************************************************************

mecca_01 (2002-11-04)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- produces exactly the files mo_mz_kpp*.f90 as they are included in
  echam5.1.04_mz02
- needs kpp version 1.1-f90-alpha
