The 6 model runs for the mechanism intercomparison presented by Sander
et al. (2019) were created with the following commands:

    ./xcaaba.py mozart
    ./xcaaba.py cb05bascoe
    ./xcaaba.py mim1
    ./xcaaba.py mom
    ./xcaaba.py mcm
    ./xcaaba.py jam

In all cases, the MOM scenario was selected using the namelist file
caaba_mom.nml.

The results are in the */caaba_mecca.nc files.

The intercomparison plot was created with cams.py.
