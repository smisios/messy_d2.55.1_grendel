SOME OF THE "diagnostic tracer" files might have been moved to the
subdirectory "old", because their base might have changed.

Please update your files in this case!

Here is a recipe on how to instrument your code with dignostic tracers:

Step 1: create your mecca-batch file WITHOUT or EMTPY diagtracfile

Step 2: create your mechanism (mecca.eqn) with ./xconfig ...

Step 3: run prodloss.exe in messy/tools/prodloss (see README there)
        (make sure prodloss.nml is correct !)

Step 4: The output gives you the standard ozone diagnostic

Step 5: add other diagnostic tracers manually to the output (tex) of Step 3/4

Step 6: copy the tex file to mecca/diagtrac/.

Step 7: add diagtracfile to your mecca batch file and recreate your 
        mechanism
