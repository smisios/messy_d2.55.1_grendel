> update: methane carbon fraction tagging cfg, IC transfer specs.
  - bugfix: erroneous PTs were added to eq. in cases the species of interest was not in the educt list of a source-specified r-n (lost?)

20140703
+ added generation of fixed species arrays + adjustments to source code generation

20150508+
> check-in w/PJ @DLR on 20150508
  - several bugfixes
  - prefixes for fractional tagging are changed: FM->FCM (Fraction of C from Methane), FI -> FCI, etc.

20150802
> tagging v.2 is introduced
  - doubling mode removed as obsolete
    - removed dbl/ directory, restructured tag/
    - MECCA scripts/code are updated accordingly
    - renamed /messy/tools/tagdbl -> /messy/tools/tag
  - improved capability of adding new equations/reactions ( sections [ADD:EQN] and [ADD:SPC] in cfg )
  + all matching patterns are based on regular expressions ( incl. embudget )
  + added the new mode of tagging which allows migration of molecules between the tagging classes to describe various conversion processes, e.g. distinguish oxidation generations
  - refurbished spaghetti-plots creation (tested with graphvis v.2.38.0)

20150809
- bugfix: loss PTs were created for budgeted species unconditionally in reactions of two tagged species (should appear only in the sink r-n of the species being budgeted)

20150921
> new: radiocarbon tagging is introduced (updated imtag_tag_common.f90 for 14C-handling routines)
> updates:
  + KIE-specific records may now use regexp-like expressions for reaction abbreviations and species names
  + indroduced strict regexp usage: only matches that eq the argument being checked are value (to avoid matching, e.g., of 14CH3O3 for 14CH3 mask)
- bugfix: KIE was added more than once to the reactions w/specified source

20151104
- (?) fixed redundant dependency that caused recompilation of SCAV even if no tagging is used
  - replaced messy_mecca_kpp -> messy_main_constants_mem in USE statement of messy_mecca_tag_si.f90-zero
- bugfix: wrong parsing of the fixed isotope composition marker (*) in cfg file

20151205
> improved configuration modules hierarchy
  - unified reference isotope standards & units -> in cfg core files (+delta-values are *internally* expressed in given units)

20160210-15
- fixes & improvements during check-in with PJ
  - lost bugfix for non-_dp masses put into tracdef
  - wrong production PTs creation in "shifting" reactions
  - former tag_src_temp is created for every configuration (tag_{%TAG}_src_temp, declaration problems)
  - code can be compiled with new fpc (ver. 3+), however *fpc versions <2.6 are not supported*
> new: selectable composition transfer mode (itransm):
  - when iatom= is specified, applies single-substituted isotope composition transfer model
  - when no iatom specified, uses fractional transfer model (species weightings specified in cfg are accounted for)
> new: eqnskip= parameter in cfg files allows skipping equations that contain species from TSL

20160220
> new: added possibility to specify isotope branching (IB, as opposed to stochastic element transfer)
  - to add IB entries, use [SRC] section of cfg files
  - an IB entry should use exact name of the isotopolgue and molecular stoichiometry, e.g.: 
    I2CH3O = 0.881 I2HCHO 0.118 I2HO2
  - IB *requires* manual specification of molecular transfer (in [SRC] section) for the selected reaction
> updates:
  - reduced tagging output in xtag/xembud
  - refurbished pascal code
- verified MIM1 and NMO (MOM-derived new methane oxidation chemistry) H-transfer
  - separate FHM and IH configurations (*-mim1 for MIM1)

20160618
+ improved detection of H2SO4 counterparts (from MECCA-TAG) in DDEP

20160712
- bugfix: code generated for "fixed" species (the SI template erroneously had the x0 imtag instruction instead of f0)

20160715
+ embudget: passive tracers acquire molar masses of budgeted species in tracdef.tex (otherwise their integrals are not being calculated in tracer_pdef)

20160818
- bugfix: extraneous reactions were created from a source specification record using the educt not present in used-TSL
- improved detection of comment lines in input *.tex files

20161217
- improved species mass handling & element table, corrected RMA calculus
- dot files creation is now selectable in cfg file [CPARAMS] section, option 'dots=FROM1 FROM2 ... > TO1 TO2 ... '
- regexp can be used for selecting r-n abbrebiations (not species yet) in transfer/source spec. records (warning: experimental)

20170110
> added an option to create diagnostic PTs for unaccounted production/loss of elemental/molecular composition (switched by USE_PT_UPL)
  - refurbished parts of code, improved mass-balance check (accounts for source specification info)
- potential bugfix in calculation of pMC values in the code generated for boxmodel
- added runtime optimisation for simulations with MC box (see TAG_OPT_SKIP_XTRABOXPPROC cfg. parameter)

20170322
> tagging version 2.5 (MESSy v.2.53.*)
  - improved tracer definition files creation, including the new MESSy chemprop facility
  - isotopologue molar masses can be rounded to given no. of digits after comma (option roundmass= )
  - improvements from F.Frank/P.Joeckel on isotope H chemistry (cfg) and tagging F90 code
  - syntax of passive tracers'' has changed from PTL*/PTP* to XPTL*/XPTP*

20171023
- bugfix: moved addinline4tagrates() after kieproc() in imtag; otherwise uninitialised variables from KIE section may be used in optimised rate calculations (op_pj_20171021)

20180605
+ added an option to check for cfg parameter (defined in [CPARAMS]) during code generation (via {>CPAR:} and {<CPAR:} meta-parentheses)
- improved info about conditional processing of cfg/generated code by imcom/imtag

20180619
> bugfixes:
  - since changes to the CHEMPROP facility, old-style detection of columns in .tex failed due to two-line column headers :O, defaults introduced
  - creation of PTs for non-tagged species in tagged reactions was wrong since CHEMPROP
  - mass of neutron (instead of unity) was given to PTs with unspecified element
  - parameter 'drsyntax' (ambuguously referring to doubled reac. syntax) renamed to 'trsyntax' (was OK in embudget but not in imtag)
  - fixed xtag which continued even when embudget was exiting with error
  - fixed issues with embudget-ing multiple configurations
  - added a fix/check for too large no. of isotopologues/tagging classes specified [20181106]
  - added drill-down to refspec of the regular species for tagged/budgeted tracers (for species not present in chemprop, like O3s) [20181120]

20190121
- corrected headers in template files (now include "created automatically" for easier location, and "do not edit")

20200301-0712
> tagging version 2.6 (MESSy v.2.55.*)
- new & updated tagging configurations
  - refurbished C & O transfer in MIM/MOM mechanisms, CO sink KIEs
  - CIO: clumped O2 isotope tagging + diagnostic (CAABA/EMAC)
  - FN: reactive N cycling tagging + turnover (CAABA/aMC)
  - FO: atomic O fraction tagging / O3, H2O, O2 as sources (CAABA/EMAC)
  - FS: organic S chemistry tagging + yields, budgeting (CAABA/EMAC)
  - parameter definition restyled for more flexible usage (those global in *_parameters.inc can be overridden on the module/cfg. level)
- [bug]fixes to the tagging code / templates etc.
  + added possibility to have class-wise fixed (nudged) composition
  - fixed errors in transfer source handling / eqn. parsing
  + added negation (!) of the pattern matching (normal/regex) for species/equation tags
  + embudget can add equations and species like imtag (using [ADD:SPC] & [ADD:EQN] config sections)
    + tracer definitions are created automatically for the added species if they have ref.spec. field (e.g. {&O3})
  - tagged species tolerances in KPP are automatically set based those for regular species
  - fpc versions below 3 are *no longer supported*

20200919
> core bugfixes:
  - imtag: configuration code was added more than once if multiple #EQUATIONS directives are present in .eqn
  - imcom_make_tracprop(): added use of tracer subnames - same PTs were created twice for tracers different subnames (e.g. N2O and N2O_c)


KNOWN ISSUES:
- if any exe bails out with SIGSEGV, it is likely that it runs into the strict system memory/stack limits => use shell 'unlimit' (or equivalent) command
- when EMAC crashes in *scan_tracs() routine, it is likely that H2O is not present/available via TRACER => switch on H2O or add H2O tracer by some means
- if a key in a *.cfg file starts with an apostrophe (``), this may cause SIGSEGV (reason unknown, likely fpc internal)

TODO:
? conditional processing of cfg
~ regexp for species in transfer/source spec. records (testing now)
? double/triple substitutions
