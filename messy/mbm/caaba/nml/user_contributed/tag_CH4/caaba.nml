&CAABA

!*** choose one or more MESSy submodels:

 USE_MECCA   = T
!USE_READJ   = T
 USE_SAPPHO  = T
 USE_SEMIDEP = T
!USE_TRAJECT = T

!*** see "list_of_scenarios" in caaba.f90 for possibilities:
 init_scenario     = 'x0_10000Pa  '
!photo_scenario    = ''
 emission_scenario = 'x0_10000Pa  '
!drydep_scenario   = ''

!*** temperature [K]
 temp = 216.65

!*** pressure [Pa]
 press = 10000

!*** relative humidity [1]
!relhum = 0.81

!*** height of the boundary layer [m]
 zmbl = 1000.

!*** fine-tuning of humidity:
l_ignore_relhum = T
!l_psat_emac     = T
!l_relhum_wmo    = T

!*** location (affects only solar zenith angle and trajectories)
degree_lat = 0.0
degree_lon = 0.0

!*** frost flower model run?
!l_ff = T

!*** day of model start
!*** note that model_start_day=0. refers to the 1st of Jan at 0:00 in
!*** the morning and therefore, e.g., model_start_day=14. refers to 15th Jan
model_start_day = 1.

!*** duration of the model run in days; default: 8
runtime_str = '730 days'
! runtime_str = '1460 days'
! runtime_str = '2920 days'
! runtime_str = '7300 days'

!*** time step length, default: 20 minutes
!timesteplen_str = '15 minutes'

!*** output step frequency (output every xth timestep)
!*** default: 1 (every timestep)
output_step_freq = 3

!*** output synchronization frequency (every xth output step (not timestep)), 
!*** note: a high value has a positive effect on performance, however, 
!***       in case of machine failure, buffered output steps are lost.
!*** default: every output step
output_sync_freq = 1000

!*** the Ca precipitation factor changes the fraction of CaCO3 contained in
!*** sea salt (only needed for frost flower model runs):
!Ca_precip = 0.3

!*** init_spec = initialize species from netcdf file:
