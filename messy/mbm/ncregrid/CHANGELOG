* messy_ncregrid_interface.f90: new SUBROUTINE
  NCREGRID_SET_MESSAGEMODE for setting the
  debug-level
* mo_mz_regrid* renamed to messy_ncregrid*
  since ncregrid is now essential part of the
  Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy)
  (http://www.messy-interface.org)

* mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90: (SUBROUTINE BALANCE_GEOHYBGRID):
  bug fix in time-balancing, in case infile and/or grdfile
  do(es) not contain time axis

  description
  Notes: - if both g_lon?, and g_lat? are omitted from
           the namelsit, NCREGRID works
         - if only one of g_lon? or g_lat is omitted,
           regridding is not possible
           -> DEPENDENCY MISMATCH !
  

-----------------------------------------------------
changes from v1.0b to v1.1b
-----------------------------------------------------
* mo_mz_regrid_base.f90: get kind-parameter via
  'USE typesizes', instead of hard-wired
* mo_mz_regrid_control.f90 (SUBROUTINE REGRID_CONTROL):
  bug-fix to exclude non-grid-conform variables from

  SUBROUTINE SCAN_NCVAR
* mo_mz_regrid_base.f90: preprocessor directives for
  NEC-SX fortran-90 compiler

  changed RGMSG-level of 'non-active RGT-events' from
  'warning' to 'information' and introduced
  'info' for 'active RGT-events'
* STOP statement in SUBROUTINE REGRID_CONTROL
  (mo_mz_regrid_control.f90) replaced
* STOP and GOTO statements in
  SUBROUTINE IMPORT_NCATT (mo_mz_regrid_nc.f90)

-----------------------------------------------------
changes from v0.9a1.10 to v1.0b
-----------------------------------------------------
* minor bug fixes + better f90/f95 standard conformance
* Bug fix in SUBROUTINE BALANCE_GEOHYBGRID_NCVAR
  (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90): Additional paprameter 'lint'
  for adjusting the time dimension of the variables in case
  'input_time = .false.' is specified in the namelist!
* Balancing of the surface pressure time dimension in
  SUBROUTINE BALANCE_GEOHYBGRID (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90)
  works now also with non-unlimited time axes.
* The maximum lenght of RGTEVENT-names (NCCNTMAXNLEN) is now
  20 instead of 10 characters (mo_mz_regrid_tools.f90).
* Fields of regridding-type IXF (index-fraction) and IDX (index)
  are not longer renamed with suffix '_f' and/or '_i'
  (SUBROUTINE IDX2FRAC_NCVAR and SUBROUTINE MAXFRAC2IDX_NCVAR
  in mo_mz_regrid_nc.f90)!
* The error messages of SUBROUTINE IMMI_NARRAY (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90)
  have been improved.
* Improved time stepping control: The defaults are now
  i_t(:) = (/ 1, 1, 0, 0 /)
  g_t(:) = (/ 1, 1, 0 /)
  o_t(:) = (/ 1, 1, 0 /)
  with the following automatic (internal) corrections:
  1) ?_t(2) are reset to 1, if the user specifies 0
  2) if i_t(3) == 0 then i_t(3) = i_t(1) (for tmax respectively)
  3) if i_t(4) == 0 then i_t(4) = i_t(1) (for tret respectively)
* Enhanced checking of time control parameters specified in
  namelist (i_t, g_t, o_t) and/or at call of REGRID_CONTROL
  (tmin, tstep, tmax, tret), for example:
   - NCREGRID in interface mode now stops,
     if i_t(1) <= i_t(4) <= i_t(3) in the namelist, or
     tmin <= tret <= tmax on subroutine call of REGRID_CONTROL,
     respectively, is not fulfilled
     (SUBROUTINE REGRID_CONTROL, mo_mz_regrid_control.f90).
   - All parameters must be non-negative.
* Bug fix: NCREGRID no longer crashes in case you have 
  2 spatial dimensions of equal length and specify
  only the 'interfaces' of one of those
  (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90, SUBROUTINE CHECK_NCVAR_ON_GEOHYBGRID).
* Feature: For spatial dimensions of length 1 it is
  now checked whether the 'range' (?_????r) is
  specified in the namelist, in case only the mids are
  given
  (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90, SUBROUTINE CHECK_GEOHYBGRID).

-----------------------------------------------------
changes from v0.9a1.09 to v0.9a1.10 (15 November 2002)
-----------------------------------------------------
* Increase of performance: Surface pressure pre-regridding is
  skipped if the input grid is 2-D (lat x lon)
  (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90: SUBROUTINE BALANCE_GEOHYBGRID_PS).
* New module in examples/tools (mo_mz_regrid_tools.f90)
  for using NCREGRID in interface-mode contains:
    SUBROUTINE RGTOOL_CONVERT
      converts a netCDF-variable into a 4D array
      with choosable order of indices
      (default: 'xyzn' where x is longitude, y latitude,
      z level, and n the parameter-dimension).
    SUBROUTINE RGTOOL_READ_NCVAR
      regrids one time slice of a netCDF-variable from
      a namelist file and returns a 4D array with choosable
      order of indices
      (default: 'xyzn' where x is longitude, y latitude,
      z level, and n the parameter-dimension).
    SUBROUTINE RGTOOL_READ_NCFILE 
      regrids one time slice of a netCDF-file from a
      namelist file and returns a 4D array with choosable
      order of indices
      (default: 'xyzn' where x is longitude, y latitude,
      z level, and n the number of variables).
    SUBROUTINE RGTOOL_G2C
      converts grid-structure into 1D (hyam, hybm, hyai, hybi,
      p0, latm, lonm, loni, lati) and 2D (ps) arrays.
    TYPE NCRGCNT
      provides a structure for storage of counter information.
    SUBROUTINE RGTOOL_NCRGCNT_RST
      controls I/O of counter information (for restart).
* Bug fix: In mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90
  (SUBROUTINE BALANCE_GEOHYBGRID_PS) the balancing of the
  horizontal grid has been removed and the 'time axis'
  balancing has been corrected.
* Workaround for a number of compilers:
  Overloading the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR (=) has been replaced
  by direct calls of SUBROUTINE COPY_???(...).
* Minor bug fix: In 'interface-mode' output time stepping
  is equal to input time stepping (in case of
  'input_time=.true.'), or equal to the interface time
  stepping (in case of 'input_time=.false.').
* A new option has been introduced for
  SUBROUTINE regrid_control(...), which can be used 
  to control the output messages:
  MSG = MSGMODE_S   -> only ERROR MESSAGES
  MSG = MSGMODE_V   -> ERROR MESSAGES + MINIMUM VERBOSE
  MSG = MSGMODE_W   -> ERROR + MIN.V. + WARNING
  MSG = MSGMODE_I   -> ERROR + MIN.V. + WARNING + INFO
* Minor bug fix ('i/g_hyar = a1, an' in namelist):
  The hybrid-A-coefficients are not longer (wrongly) treated
  as monotonic; the order of the two real values in the
  namelist determine the upper range ('a1' = highest grid level,
  corresponding to the smallest hybrid-B-coefficient) and the
  lower range ('an' = lowest grid level, corresponding to
  the largest hybrid-B-coefficient).
* Output of INFO/WARNING/ERROR messages completely
  reorganized
* Bug fix in SUBROUTINE NREGRID (mo_mz_regrid_base.f90)
  for regridding of EXT-Type fields
* New installation procedure: A configure-script has
  been added. Editing the Makefile(s) is now obsolete.
* Workaround for the IBM-AIX compiler (Internal compiler
  error, if runtime-checking is enabled):
  Temporal storage of INTEGER FUNCTION POSITION(...)-
  RESULTS in integer variables.
  (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90 (SUBROUTINE H2PSIG)).

-----------------------------------------------------
changes from v0.9a1.08 to v0.9a1.09 (16 October 2002)
-----------------------------------------------------
* mo_mz_regrid_control.f90:
  Time step control: i_t(2), g_t(2), and o_t(2) are
  automatically reset to 1 if specified as 0
  in the namelist.
* mo_mz_regrid_control.f90:
  A new control option has been introduced
  for SUBROUTINE regrid_control(...):
  RG_CTRL = RG_STOP
  This can be used in interface mode to terminate
  ncregrid correctly (i.e., including memory cleaning)
  on conditions from within an endless DO-loop, already
  before the end of the namelist-file is reached.
* mo_mz_regrid_base.f90: improved initialization
  of type-structs
* mo_mz_regrid_nc.f90: improved initialization
  of type-structs
* mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90: 3 unused variables deleted

-------------------------------------------------
changes from v0.9a1.07 to v0.9a1.08 (August 2002)
-------------------------------------------------
* Major bug fix in the SUBROUTINE NREGRID
  (mo_mz_regrid_base.f90): In previous versions,
  invariant dimensions have not been handled correctly
  in all cases.
* Bug fix in SUBROUTINE BALANCE_GEOHYBGRID_PS
  (mo_mz_regrid_geohyb.f90) to allow for invariant
  horizontal dimensions in 3-D regridding.
* A number of bug fixes for usage of NCREGRID in
  'interface-mode'.
* Improved NREGRID STATISTICS.

----------------------------------------------
changes from v0.8bR* to v0.9a1.07 (Jul 2002)
----------------------------------------------
* The code has been completely rewritten!
  Older versions (0.8bR?) are NOT LONGER SUPPORTED!
