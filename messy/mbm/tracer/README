A HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED BASEMODEL INTERFACE LAYER (BMIL)
====================================================
(.) messy_main_data_bi.f90           ! a simple data transfer module
(.) messy_main_mpi_bi.f90            ! a replacement for a parallel environ.

THE GENERIC SUBMODEL TRACER
===========================
SUBMODEL CORE LAYER (SMCL):
(*)  messy_main_constants_mem.f90    ! SMCL constants for various MESSy SMs
                                     ! (Not all of the contents is needed in
                                     !  the simplified TRACER box model.)
(*)  messy_main_tools.f90            ! SMCL tools for varius MESSy submodels
                                     ! (Not all of the contents is needed in
                                     !  the simplified TRACER box model.)
(*)  messy_main_tracer.f90           ! SMCL of the submodel TRACER
(*)  messy_main_tracer_family.f90    ! SMCL of the sub-submodel TRACER_FAMILY
(*)  messy_main_tracer_pdef.f90      ! SMCL of the sub-submodel TRACER_PDEF
SUBMODEL INTERFACE LAYER (SMIL):
(**) messy_main_tracer_family_bi.f90 ! SMIL of the sub-submodel TRACER_FAMILY
(**) messy_main_tracer_pdef_bi.f90   ! SMIL of the sub-submodel TRACER_PDEF
USER INTERFACE (UI):
(*)  tracer.nml                      ! UI namelist file for the SM TRACER
                                     ! and the sub-submodels

'ORDINARY SUBMODELS'
====================
A submodel for defining new tracers via a namelist:
(*)  messy_ptrac.f90                 ! SMCL of the submodel PTRAC
(**) messy_ptrac_si.f90              ! SMIL of the submodel PTRAC
(*)  ptrac.nml                       ! UI namelist file for the SM PTRAC     

A dummy submodel to access the tracers (initialize, diffuse, decay):
(-) messy_othersm.f90                ! SMCL of the submodel OTHERSM
(-) messy_othersm_si.f90             ! SMIL of the submodel OTHERSM
(-) othersm.nml                      ! UI namelist file for the SM OTHERSM

NOTES:
======
(*)  These files/modules need NOT to be changed in order to use TRACER in
     another basemodel.
(**) These files/modules are automatically created from the respective
     files of a GCM application with an older naming convention.
(+)  These files/modules need to be rewritten for any other basemodel. The
     examples of the simple basemodel here, however, show the overall structure
     and the usage of the TRACER interface.
(.)  These files/modules constitute a highly simplified basemodel and are
     usually replaced by a specific model.
(-)  These files/modules represent a simple MESSy submodel which is useless
     outside the context of the simpified basemodel.

HOWTO COMPILE/RUN
=================
1. Edit the file 'Makefile' and put in your specific compiler settings.
   Do not forget to activate the pre-processor!

2. > gmake
   Note: The 'Makefile' includes 'main.mk' and 'depend.mk'. The latter
         contains the file dependencies, which are automatically updated
         (see 5 below).
   Note: Other usefule gmake-targets are 'gmake clean' and 'gmake distclean'.

3. > gmake run

4. Change entries in
    - tracer.nml
    - ptrac.nml-raw
    - othersm.nml
   and go back to 3.
   Note: The namelist file 'ptrac.nml' is created from 'ptrac.nml-raw' with
         the sh-sript 'copynml.sh', which essentially removes all comments.
         (Some compilers seem to have problems ...).

5. Change the code and go back to 2,3,4.
   Note: The file dependencies are automatically updated with the perl-script
         'sfmakedepend'. Make sure that the path to 'perl' in the very first
         line of this script is OK.
