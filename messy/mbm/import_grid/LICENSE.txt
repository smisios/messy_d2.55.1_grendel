The source code of import_grid (formerly ncregrid)
is available under the GNU General Public License
(GPL, see GPL.txt). Since the GPL was not written for scientific software,
the following additional terms apply for using import_grid (formerly ncregrid): 

* If you implement import_grid (fully or partly) in your own code
  (e.g., into a global 3-dimensional model), please cite
  "P. Jöckel, ncregrid: A tool for rediscretisation of geo-data,
   http://www.p-joeckel.de/ncregrid/, (2002)"
  in the 'Model description' section (or equivalent) of resulting
  publications. 
* If you use import_grid as 'stand-alone' program for handling your data,
  I would appreciate a note in the 'Acknowledgements' of your resulting
  publications. 
* Please send me a reprint of your publication. I would also appreciate
  a preprint when you submit your manuscript. 
* If you change or extend import_grid (by writing additional code),
  you must also make it available using this (or a similar license).
  This includes also code (e.g. Makefile) for porting import_grid to other
  platforms.
  Please e-mail your new code to
     ncregrid@p-joeckel.de
  This will help us to coordinate further developments of the code.
