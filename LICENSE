Licence Conditions

The usage of MESSy can be licenced to all affiliates of institutions, 
which are member of the MESSy Consortium, i.e., which signed the 
MESSy Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) (see subdirectory LICENCE).

End-users have in addition to

    * sign and follow the MESSy Community End-User Licence Agreement (EULA) 
      (see subdirectory LICENCE),
    * accept the MESSy Software Licence Agreement (SLA)
      (see subdirectory LICENCE),
    * follow the MESSy Citation Rules (CiR) (see web-site),
    * follow the MESSy Coding Rules (CoR) 
      for the further development of MESSy.

Before an end-user can become licensee, she/he has to

    * provide (together with the signed EULA, see above) 
      to the Consortium Steering Group (CSG)
    * a detailed Letter of Intent (as PDF), which contains
        - the institution with full address,
        - the e-mail address of the end-user,
        - a description of what is intended to do with MESSy 
          (including a description of planned funding proposals),
        - a list of submodels to be used.
    * provide to the CSG a copy of the licence grant for third-party software
     for which the MESSy Consortium is not copyright holder
     (see web-site).


At any time the licensee has to

    inform the CSG about plans to apply for external funding, 
    if the proposal involves the application and/or further development 
    of MESSy (in order to avoid conflicts of interest).
