# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it parses. 
# With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension. 
# Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this tag. 
# The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and language is one of 
# the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, C#, C, C++, D, PHP, 
# Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make doxygen treat 
# .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran), 
# use: inc=Fortran f=C

# The SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the internal cache use to 
# determine which symbols to keep in memory and which to flush to disk. 
# When the cache is full, less often used symbols will be written to disk. 
# For small to medium size projects (<1000 input files) the default value is 
# probably good enough. For larger projects a too small cache size can cause 
# doxygen to be busy swapping symbols to and from disk most of the time 
# causing a significant performance penality. 
# If the system has enough physical memory increasing the cache will improve the 
# performance by keeping more symbols in memory. Note that the value works on 
# a logarithmic scale so increasing the size by one will rougly double the 
# memory usage. The cache size is given by this formula: 
# 2^(16+SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range is 0..9, the default is 0, 
# corresponding to a cache size of 2^16 = 65536 symbols

# file name after the option, if omitted DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name 
# of the layout file.
