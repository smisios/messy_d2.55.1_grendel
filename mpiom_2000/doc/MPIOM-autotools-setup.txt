The following is relevant to people who want to make additions to the
autoconfiscated build setup currently (2009/02/10) introduced.

I. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING THE MODEL

To keep the source directory clean from any file introduced in a
(potentially failed) build the following strategy is recommended:

1. Put your copy of the sources (from archive or svn checkout) in some
   directory in your home directory, i.e. '$HOME/work/mpiom'.
2. Make another directory to do the build for a particular machine and
   run the setup and make from there, i.e.:

   > mkdir $HOME/build/machineA
   > cd $HOME/build/machineA
   > $HOME/work/mpiom/configure
   [...]
   > make

II. PREREQUISITES FOR SOURCE-LEVEL CHANGES

For the rerun of 'autoreconf' to succeed, automake must be version 1.10 or
newer and autoconf version 2.60 or newer. This can be checked by
running

   > autoconf --version
   autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.61
   [...]
   > automake --version
   automake (GNU automake) 1.10.1
   [...]

III. EXTENDING THE MODEL

To add a source file to mpiom.x please:

1. Put your file in a sub-directory of the tree ('src/' or 'src_hamocc/'
   being the usual places).

2. Add your sources to the build system, either

 a. To compile it into 'bin/mpiom.x', change the 'mpiom_x_SOURCES'
    primary in bin/Makefile.am by adding your file to the list.

 b. To build a standalone program for your files, add the intended
    binary name to the bin_PROGRAMS primary in bin/Makefile.am and add
    an appropriate _SOURCES primary to bin/Makefile.am.

    I.e. to add a program called foo consisting of src/bar.f90 and
    src_hamocc/baz.f90 add the following lines to bin/Makefile.am:

    foo_SOURCES = ../src/bar.f90 ../src_hamocc/baz.f90

    and append foo to bin_PROGRAMS to read

    bin_PROGRAMS=mpiom.x foo

3. Run 'autoreconf' to regenerate bin/Makefile.am.

IV. ADDING OTHER FILES (i.e. documentation)

Also any file intended for distribution and not directly part of some
automake primary (i.e. some _SOURCES directive) should be mentioned in
an EXTRA_DIST primary of the corresponding directories Makefile.am.

The vpath abilities of automake mean that source files might not be
present in the build tree. Therefore test for source file presence in
self-written Makefile rules like this:

foo: bar
	baz `test -e bar || echo $(srcdir)/`bar

If additional autoconf macros have to be added, please copy the
corresponding .m4 file (e.g. from the autoconf macro archive [1]) to
the m4 subdirectory of the source tree root. If you write it yourself,
please remember to declare macros intended for direct use in
configure.ac with AC_DEFUN so aclocal can resolve references to it.
Since MPIOM is regularly built in a cross compilation setup, please
try stick with compile tests as much as possible. Run tests will have
to be preempted with appropriate cache values.

If one of configure.ac or the Makefile.am files is changed, please
rerun the autotools with

autoreconf

prior to committing your changes.

V. CAVEATS

Since automake does not yet deliver full-fledged dependency tracking
for Fortran sources, any directory with fortran sources should copy the
all-local hook rule and inclusion from bin/Makefile.am.
