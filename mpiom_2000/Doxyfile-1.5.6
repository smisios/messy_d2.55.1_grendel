# Doxyfile 1.5.6

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file must _only_ contain those entries
# that were no longer supported after 1.5.6.
# 1.5.7 was buggy, so we do not really support it.

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the DETAILS_AT_TOP tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will output the detailed description near the top, like JavaDoc.
# If set to NO, the detailed description appears after the member 
# documentation.

DETAILS_AT_TOP         = YES
