INSTALLATION
------------

Please see the file INSTALLATION for instructions on compiling the model.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------

Please refer to doc/MPIOM-autotools-setup.txt for information on how
to add your own source files to the model.

RUNNING
-------

To run mpi-om change to mpi-om/run and edit the file prepare_run_mpiom_omip
The user needs to change EXPNO and the pathes to the WRKDIR, ARCHIVE, etc.

The user can change cpu's and parallelization strategy
e.g for using MPI parallelization on 4 cpus:

	ncpus=4
	nprocx=2
	nprocy=2
	MPIOM_THREADS=1


e.g. for using OpenMP parallelization on 4 cpus:

	ncpus=1
	nprocx=1
	nprocy=1
	MPIOM_THREADS=4


Note: The variable OMP_NUM_THREADS is now ignored by MPIOM, please use MPION_THREADS instead.

Edit machine specific items like qsub options, cpu hours, cpu numbers,
etc and run the prepare script. It will create some directories and an
example jobsript run_mpiom in $WRKDIR.

Forcing fields (omip 365 days) and initial data (restart file after 200 
years integration) for the 3 deg setup called GR30 can be found in the 
included pool directory. Other setups and tools for setting up new grids can be
 made available on request.

TEST FOR CORRECTNESS

VISUALISATION 
-------------

Cdo package (http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/%7Ecdo/) can be used to create
NetCDF files outouf MPIOM EXTRA Files; grid description files for
scalar and vector points can be found in the pool directory, e.g.

 cdo -t mpiom1 -f nc -setgrid,GR30s.nc \
-selindexbox,2,121,1,101 -setgrid,r122x101 file.ext file.nc

'-t mpiom1' usues a predefined table to create variable names ouf of
codenumber 

'-f nc' set output format to netCDF 

'-setgrid,GR30s.nc' grid description file for scalar points 

'-selindexbox,2,121,1,101' removes cyclic boundaries from the 
output file 

'-setgrid,r122x101' tells cdo the number of lat and lons of the input grid

Note that for some plotting packages (e.g. ferret) vector properties 
needs to be rotated back onto a N/S/E/W grid. A GMT based plotting utility
 is available on request.
