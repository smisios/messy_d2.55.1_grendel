-  added new Namelist parameter lzint_above_ground to choose z-interpolation to
    height levels above ground
    relevant Namelist group: GRIBOUT
    parameter: lzint_above_ground
    lzint_above_ground=.FALSE. (Default): z-interpolation above Sea Level
    lzint_above_ground=.TRUE.           : z-interpolation above ground
    modules affected:
    - data_io.f90
    - io_metadata.f90
    - organize_data.f90
    - src_output.f90
    - netcdf_io.f90
   
-  set the 'l'-flag (land-sea dependency) for HORIZON, SKYVIEW, SLO_ANG, SLO_ASP, and SWDIR_COR
    which are only defined over land; corresponding initial data coming from INT2LM are undefined 
    over water bodies since the 'l'-flag is also used in INT2LM
    modules affected:
    - src_setup_vartab.f90

-  changes to correct a bug which causes a crash for the namelist option lradtopo=.TRUE.
    Shadowing effects (lradtopo=.TRUE.) should work now.
    module affected:
    - src_input.f90
     in case of lradtopo=.TRUE. reset values of slo_ang, slo_asp, and horizon to
     zero for non-land-points only
     in case of lradtopo=.TRUE. reset values of skyview to
     one for non-land-points only

    IMPORTANT NOTE: 
    - applying lradtopo=.TRUE. requires nradcoarse=1; otherwise job would stop
    - nradcoarse=1 requires lradf_avg=.FALSE.; otherwise job would stop

- src_soil_multlay.f90
     delete factor 0.5 in definition of zalpha to be in accordance to ICON coding

- netcdf_io.f90
     added a "T" in the time units attribute
     changes due to the new option lzint_above_ground
     
- src_spectral_nudging.f90
     added option to nudge over all wave numbers (this is grid nudging actually) by setting
        isc_sn=-1, jsc_sn=-1 for lspecnudge=.TRUE. Other spectral nudging otions can be used
        as usual.

September 09, 2016  B. Rockel, HZG
    bug fix to correctly write output files after a restart in case of asynchronous I/O
    module affected:
    - netcdf_io.f90

July 06, 2016 H.-J. Panitz, IMK/KIT  
    bug fix related to ISBA version of bare soil evaporation (itype_evsl=3)
    module affected:
    - src_soil_multlay.f90
    does change results in case of itype_evsl=3
    short explanation (for details see source code):
     The coefficients b2 and b4, used in the calculation of saturation vapor pressure,
     have to be calculated in dependence of the location(grid point i,j).
     This had not been done before, the coefficients had fixed values that changed
     when the domain decomposition changed. 
     Thus, b2 and b4 have to be recalculated taking into account the grid point position.
     This is done taking into account whether the surface temperature t_s is higher or lower than the melting
     temperature t0_melt.
     Depending on this the coefficients b2 for water or ice, and b4 for water
     or ice are chosen for their usage in the function to determine the
     saturation vapor pressure

June 28, 2016 H.-J. Panitz, IMK/KIT  
    avoid call of SR hydci in case of restart together with case ldiniprec=.TRUE.
    otherwise restart job would crash at once
    module affected:
      organize_physics.f90
    In case of  ldiniprec=.TRUE. SR hydci must only be called once for
    initialization during the very first time-step of a simulation
    But: the  "action=init" branch n organize_physics.f90 is also excecuted in case of restart;
        thus SR hydci was called again and the simulation crashed
    Solution: SR hydci is called only if ldiniprec=.TRUE. and ntstep==0
    - does not change the results; avoids crashes in case of restart only

May, 11, 2016 H.-J. Panitz, IMK/KIT

May, 11, 2016 H.-J. Panitz, IMK/KIT
  in main program lmorg.F90
     change sequence of calculation for nzdays in case of lbdclim=T
      - necessary to get a meaningful value in cases of very large ntstep
      - on MISTRAL change was necessary to avoid crash of long-term simulation when
        simulation time > 68 years is reached
      - does not change the results

   new option for calculation of bare soil evaportion
   Calculation of bare soil evaporation using a resistance formulation.
   For a review see Schulz et al. (1998)
   option can be chosen by namelist parameter itype_evsl=4 (Physics Group)
   Does change the results if the new option is chosen

   extend model abort if resistance version of parameterization of bare soil evaporation
    (itype_evsl=4) is chosen together with one layer soil model;

Dec, 04, 2015   B. Rockel, HZG
 
   Bug fix to correctly write all attributes into the header of NetCDF files
   in case of asynchronous I/O
   It had been forgotten to distribute the irefatm=2 parameters delta_t and h_scal to all
   I/O processes. The consequence was that the values of these parameters, which are attributes of the
   vertical coordinate "vcoord", were wrong, namely -9999. And this then might lead to problems/crashes in 
   subsequent INT2LM runs, if one wants to perform a further downscaling (lm2lm=.TRUE.)
   The bug did not affect the results of the the model!

  Due to consistency reason change name of wet bulb temperature to wbtemp_13c
  module affected:
  - netcdf_io.f90, SR write_nc_gdefs

2)
  Bug fix in src_soil_multlay.f90 in case of restarts when using the option itype_heatcond=2. 
  Without the bug fix restart runs will not produce binary identical results compared to continuous runs.
  The bug was related to a missing setting of w_so_ice at time-level nnew.
  This has been corrected by Burkhardt Rockel

   for use in the calibration of COSMO 5.0 the following changes were
   added to the code:
   * The former internal constant parameter uc1 was converted into a tuning
     parameter, which can be specified in the /TUNING/ namelist block of
     INPUT_ORG (default value as before 0.8_ireals).
   * Three additional tuning namelist parameters were defined in INPUT_ORG
   - radfac (fraction of cloud water/ice used in radiation scheme) before this
     was hardcoded to be 0.5_ireals (which is still the default value)
   - fac_rootdp2 (uniform multiplication factor for the prescribed root depth values)
     default: 1.0_ireals (tested range [0.5_ireals,1.5_ireals])
   - soilhyd (uniform multiplication factor for hydraulic conductivity and
     diffusivity in the soil)
     default: 1.0_ireals (tested range [0.1_ireals,10.0_ireals])
    modules affected:
    - data_constants.f90
      uc1 is no longer a constant
    - data_radiation.f90

 additional test in check_record whether U, V, and T initial- and boundary data 
 are o.k.
 It is checked whether the  mean value in a layer is very small, respectively < ABS(1.E-30).
 If this is the case, it is assumed that the mean value is actually zero what means that the whole layer
 contains only zero values. A WARNING is written at the end of the corresponding control record in file YUCHKDAT.
 This helps to identify such a crazy situation which indicates that either the boundary data are wrong themselves
 or that an Input error occurred while reading the data record.
 Of course,  in order to identify the problem it is necessary and recommended to write the ckeck records
 of the initial and boundary data into the YUCHKDAT file, namely that the Namelist parameters "lchkini" and "lckbd" are set to .TRUE.!

  bug fix in implicit solver of heat conduction equation
  changes results only if itype_heatcond=2
  module affected:
  - src_soil_multlay.f90

 Here the explanation of Jan-Peter:
 "In the implicit solver the
 coefficients "zaga" and "zagc" are computed. Currently, both
 computations use "zakb" which contains "zalam(i,j,kso)". The latter is
 the soil thermal conductivity, which is defined on soil layer interfaces
 (half levels).

 And here is the error: "zaga" and "zagc" need to be computed with
 "zalam" at the upper and the lower layer interface, respectively. This
 is done in the code correction.

 This correction will change the model results if itype_heatcond=2 in
 the physics NAMELIST PHYCTL is set, i.e. when the soil thermal
 conductivity is not constant in the vertical. In the case
 itype_heatcond=1, which is usually our operational setup, the soil
 thermal conductivity is constant in the vertical (and in time),
 therefore the error has no undesired consequence, but this is more by
 chance."

   - Change ltkeconv to ltkecon since ltkecon is the name of the Namelistvariable
   - Change ELSEIF Statment since TKE tendencies due to convection (tket_conv), which are are needed
      for ltkecon=.TRUE., are calculated also in case of shallow convection (itype_conv=3)
   - Change the corresponding Warning since ltkecon is presently not supported by IFS convection scheme

November  13, 2013, H.-J. Panitz, KIT

  implementation of optional usage of IFS convection scheme 
  instead of Tiedtke scheme
  Version of IFS scheme: IFS_Cy33r1, which has been modified by Anne Roches in order to make
  it compatible with the tracer module 

  Principle procedure that has been done:
  If one wants to use the IFS convection scheme one has to do the following steps:
    1.) copy the  directory "IFS" from "work" into the "src" directory
    2.) copy the module src_conv_ifs.f90 form "work" into the "src" directory 
    3.) substitute the "ObjDependencies" and "ObjFiles" by "ObjDependencies_IFS" and "ObjFiles_IFS",
        but retain the file names "ObjDependencies" and "ObjFiles" 
    4.) the IFS scheme is conditionally compiled; thus, add the option -DCLM to your compiler flags (in file Fopts)
        and re-compile
    5.) if you want to use the IFS scheme, set itype_conv=2 in Namelist-group "phyctl" (yes, itype_conv=2 is correct!!!)
